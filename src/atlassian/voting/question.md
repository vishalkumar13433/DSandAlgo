Problem Title: Voting

Problem Description:

We are going to implement a function that determines the winner of a round of ShipIt / a hackathon. Our function is going to look something like this:

/**
* Process a list of ballots, and return all candidates sorted in descending order by their total number of points received.
  */
  List<String> getResults(List<Ballot> ballots)
  We pass in a list of ballots and we return a list of candidate names in descending order of the total number of points that each candidate received.

Assume that we extract the candidates' names from the votes as we process them.

A voter is allowed to vote for up to three different candidates. The order of the votes is important. The first vote that a voter places is worth three points. The second vote is worth two points. The third vote is worth one point.

The function should return a list of candidates in descending order of the total number of points received by the candidate.

Interviewer Notes

CONCEPTUAL THINKING: Did they formulate an approach once the question and requirements become clear? Did they communicate their approach effectively?
Look for questions around boundary conditions such as dealing with a tie. This is a good sign, but defer the answer until later.

CODE QUALITY: All of these elements are framed in such a way that the candidate will need to create representations for all of the elements —
a vote and a candidate.
